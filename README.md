# Houston Neighborhood Rating App 

<p>We designed this full stack application because we love our very, very large city and wanted everyone to have the chance to explore its different neighborhooods and find ratings and comments from those who are from or live in those neighborhoods. Users can rate their neighborhood based on four properties: school system, entertainment scene, outdoor recreation, and home prices. Have a look around. We hope you find a place to love in Houston as much as we do!</p>
